How is the logged in user being kept track of?
 - First the user's instance is added to the session inside of `do_login`. Secondly, the user is being added to the `g` object in every request that is made in the `before_request` method.

What is Flaskâ€™s g object?
 - G object is an application context where we can store data for every request. Its a one-time use-case for every request being made. It gets torn down after the request is made.

What is the purpose of add_user_to_g?
 - It keeps track of if a user is logged in. If a user is logged in, the user is then assigned to the `g.user` key-value as the user's instance.

What does @app.before_request mean?
 - Before every request is made, it is a decorator that that will execute before every request. It is similar to unittest's `setup` feature (typically paired with `tear down`)
